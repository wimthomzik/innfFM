# Innofm Website

This repository contains the source code for the website [innofm.de](https://www.innofm.de), which was my very first project in web development. As such, it represents my initial steps into the world of coding and web design, with a focus on experimenting and learning.

While the code quality reflects my beginner status at the time, this project holds a special place for me as it marks the starting point of my development journey.

## Features 

- **Responsive Layout:** The website adjusts to different screen sizes, making it accessible across devices.
- **Reusable Components:** Custom components such as the header and footer are created in JavaScript for reusability.
- **Episode Embeds:** Each podcast episode is embedded using Spotify’s player, enabling visitors to listen directly on the site.
- **Dynamic Load More Button:** Only a few episodes are shown initially, with the option to load more via a "Load More" button.
- **Feedback Section:** Includes a feedback form where listeners can send suggestions or comments via email.

## Known Issues

As this was my first attempt at web development, the project contains several significant flaws:

- **Poor Code Quality:** The code is inefficient, messy, and lacks proper organization. There’s minimal separation of concerns, and the structure could have been vastly improved with better planning. It’s clear that many parts were hastily written without a full understanding of best practices.
- **Minimal Mobile Optimization:** Although some effort was made for mobile responsiveness, it’s poorly executed. The layout can break on smaller devices, and certain features are difficult to use or don’t display correctly on mobile.
- **Bloated and Redundant Files:** Many files are unnecessarily large, with repetitive code that could easily have been condensed. For example, CSS and JavaScript are cluttered with unused styles and functions, making it harder to maintain or expand upon.
- **Scalability Issues:** The current structure is not designed to handle growth. Adding more episodes or content would lead to chaos in the codebase. There’s no modularity, and everything is hard-coded, making updates a cumbersome process.
- **Outdated Techniques:** The project relies on vanilla JavaScript and basic HTML/CSS without utilizing modern tools or frameworks that would have made development faster, cleaner, and more efficient.

This project clearly shows the struggles of a beginner, with little attention to performance or scalability. It stands as an example of what **not** to do in web development.
